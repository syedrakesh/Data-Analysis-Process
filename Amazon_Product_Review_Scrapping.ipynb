      "Wow! I ordered these over-the-ear headphones because my Samsung eat buds were never comfortable for me and they would often fall out of my ear, which is really a problem when that happens on a plane and the darn things rolls to who knows where under someone else's seat! Well, I just decided to forget about stupid ear buds and just get a set of over-the-ear noise canceling headphones. I was not about to shell out big bucks for them because I didn't think I would use them so much, mostly just when I'm traveling. So I looked over many options in the under $50 range and I chose these. I received them same day from Amazon. That was awesome! I opened the box, charged them fully in 2 hours. The usb to usb-c cord is included but you have to supply your own electrical power plug to plug it into a wall outlet to get the fastest charging. It also came with a 3.5mm audio cable as well. Pairing with my phone's Bluetooth was super easy, just follow the little instruction booklet. I started playing some music and I was so happy with the sound. These particular headphones have other great features like sound mode selection and the ability to turn off the noise canceling feature if you need to be able to hear the ambient sound around you while using them. Great Value for someone who's looking for comfort and good performance at a great price!\n",

      "pros- great sound, decent bass, holds a charge great, noise canceling is greatcons- could be more durable. the swivel joint is the weak pointi'm on my third pair. first one for me i use daily, no problems. second pair for my wife, used daily and all day some days. its great for someone with sensory issues needing to drown out the world. accidently broke the second pair at the weak point mentioned afore. totally our fault. ordering a third to replace the broken set. dont get me wrong the broken set still works and works pretty well. will save them for a hacking project or parts. only reason this doesnt get 5 stars is the weak point. if they fixed that and used a more durable plastic the price would go up. overall im very satisfied for the value and performance these provide.\n",

      "Price: AffordableShipping: Came in time and in tact.Look: It’s so aesthetically appealing!Hookup to Bluetooth: Easy, don’t even need to read the instructions.Sound: this is my only problem, it sounds good on low or medium. But the bass is terrible. I love my headphones booming in my ear.. so if you don’t have settings to try to adjust the bass so it can sound good then it’s ehhhhh.That is truly my only problem but that’s major problem from someone who loves music. But everything else is good.Real rating is : 3.7 but they’re not terrible at all. Just the bass when you turn the volume ALL the UP ONLY.\n",

      "I have several pairs of more expensive headphones and ear buds, but these get the job done at a price you can't beat.  The bluetooth connectivity works fantastic.  I usually leave these at work and every day when I turn them on the multpoint connectivity kicks right in and connects to both my phone and my laptop, and they stay connected.The range is excellent, buttons intuitive, battery life excellent, speed of transfer when I'm streaming music or video on PC and receive a call on my cell near instant, sound quality for music/video good to very good IMO - for calls fantastic both what you hear and what the person on the other end hears, transparency seems great, noise canceling ehh passable.  Only complaint at this price point is I would've gladly paid a few extra bucks for a case for when I wanna take them with me, but like I said I pretty much got these to leave at my work station anyway.\n",
